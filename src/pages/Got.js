<div className='pt-[50px] text-justify'>Game of Thrones is an American
fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for
HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels
by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show
premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May
19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.
Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a
large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of
the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms
of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families
either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whomever
sits on it.<br/><br/> The second major arc focuses on the last descendant of
the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is
plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's
Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond
Westeros's northern border.
Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active,
and international fan base. Many critics and publications have named the show
one of the greatest television series of all time. Critics have praised the
series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production
values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual
violence) generated controversy. The final season received significant

criticism for its reduced length and creative decisions, with many considering
it a disappointing conclusion.<br/><br/> The series received 59 Primetime Emmy
Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in
2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo
Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five nominations
for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series â€“ Drama.
A prequel series, House of the Dragon, premiered on HBO in 2022. A second
prequel currently in production, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, is scheduled
to debut in 2025.</div>
